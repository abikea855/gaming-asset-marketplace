# Gaming Asset Marketplace

## Overview

A revolutionary cross-game digital asset trading platform built on blockchain technology, enabling players to truly own, trade, and transfer their in-game items and characters across different gaming ecosystems. This platform transforms gaming assets into valuable, transferable NFTs that retain their worth beyond individual games.

## Problem Statement

Traditional gaming operates in walled gardens where players invest countless hours and money into digital assets that:
- Remain locked within single game ecosystems

- **True Digital Ownership**: Converting in-game assets to blockchain-based NFTs
- **Cross-Game Compatibility**: Enabling asset transfer between supported games
